<p>Wanting to move away from Dropbox, I tried out <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/sync/downloads">BTSync</a> as an alternative. Although not a complete replacement, it definitely has its perks.</p>

<p>BTSync does have a slackware version available that <a href="http://github.com/overbyrn/UnRAID">Overbyrn</a> has compiled into a unRAID plugin <a href="http://github.com/overbyrn/UnRAID">here</a>. I run this on my box as a server, with my Mac, Nexus, and iPhone as clients to sync random files, ebooks, etc.</p>

<p>My main reason for using BTSync is security. BTSync uses P2P sharing to sync files only between devices with the assigned private security key. No data is moved to foreign servers.</p>

<p>Definitely more secure, but also not widely used. Sharing data with other users or clients requires them to have the BTSync client installed, so it&rsquo;s not the best option for ALL scenarios, but if you&rsquo;re looking to keep directories and files in-sync across multiple devices it fits the bill quite well.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I run an <a href="http://lime-technology.com/">unRAID</a> server at home for serving media, TimeMachine backups, managing libraries, and pretty much anything else I can throw at it. For being a small (under 500MB) slackware distro, it has huge potential.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons I chose unRAID over alternatives, was being able to run a JBOD array. If I have a spare disk laying around, whether it&rsquo;s 500GB or 2TB, I can throw it in the unRAID box. I can lose one disk in my array, and still recover data via the parity disk, so it provides the redundancy I need for non-essential data (movies, music, etc).</p>

<br>


<p>unRAID also runs off a USB key, which saves me a SATA port on my motherboard. I&rsquo;m running unRAID on an old Dell P4 machine I had laying around, and I&rsquo;ve never felt like I&rsquo;m running out of resources. unRAID is running a handful of media applications, and also acts as a <a href="http://plex.tv/">Plex</a> server. Highly recommended if you&rsquo;re into tinkering.</p>
