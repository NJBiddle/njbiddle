    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<br>


<p>Recently I had the opportunity to install, configure, and work off of a new <a href="http://www.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> installation in our office. We&rsquo;re slowly building a design and development team, and needed a solution for code versioning and project management.</p>

<br>

<p>Installation took roughly 2 hours, and Gitlab provides a very detailed walkthrough <a href="http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci/blob/master/doc/install/installation.md">here</a> for Ubuntu and Deb. I&rsquo;m running this on a Ubuntu 12.04 VM locally in our office, and haven&rsquo;t had any real issues with it besides some complications with email flow. When running email through an exchange server like we are at the office, some extra tweaks are needed to the config files and exch server.</p>

<p>Once Gitlab is installed and your SSH keys are set up properly, it functions nearly exactly like github does. Creating projects, cloning repos, and creating user accounts is a breeze.</p>

<br>

<p>Having trouble in Gitlab? Be sure to check the logs tabs to see what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<br>


<p>If you&rsquo;re not already using a VPN, you need to start. Securing your traffic while on public networks and creating a simple point of access to your home network can be accomplished quickly if you&rsquo;re already using <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/index">DD-WRT</a>.</p>

<br>


<p><img src="/images/vpn/vpn4.png" alt="DD-WRT VPN" /></p>

<br>


<!--more-->


<p>First, start running <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/index">DD-WRT</a> or <a href="http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato">Tomato</a> on your router at home. After you&rsquo;re up and running, configuring the VPN is easy. Head over to Services > VPN, and enter your config options as seen below:</p>

<br>


<p><img src="/images/vpn/vpn.png" alt="DD-WRT config" /></p>

<br>


<p>NOTE: Be sure to use correct formatting in the username/password field</p>

<p><code> username * password * </code></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to enable PPTP VPN in Security > VPN Passthrough</p>

<br>


<p><img src="/images/vpn/vpn2.png" alt="DD-WRT VPN passthrough" /></p>

<br>


<p>Configure the VPN client-side, and you&rsquo;ll be good to go. If you need help, drop a line below.</p>

    <link href="http://njbiddle.com/blog/2014/02/15/btsync/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-15T14:40:24-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://njbiddle.com/blog/2014/02/15/btsync</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<br>


<p>Wanting to move away from Dropbox, I tried out <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/sync/downloads">BTSync</a> as an alternative. Although not a complete replacement, it definitely has its perks.</p>

<br>


<p><img src="/images/btsync/btsync.png" alt="BTSync" /></p>

<br>


<!--more-->


<p>BTSync does have a slackware version available that <a href="http://github.com/overbyrn/UnRAID">Overbyrn</a> has compiled into a unRAID plugin <a href="http://github.com/overbyrn/UnRAID">here</a>. I run this on my box as a server, with my Mac, Nexus, and iPhone as clients to sync random files, ebooks, etc.</p>

<br>


<p><img src="/images/btsync/btsync2.png" alt="BTSync" /></p>

<br>


<p>My main reason for using BTSync is security. BTSync uses P2P sharing to sync files only between devices with the assigned private security key. No data is moved to foreign servers.</p>

<p>Definitely more secure, but also not widely used. Sharing data with other users or clients requires them to have the BTSync client installed, so it&rsquo;s not the best option for ALL scenarios, but if you&rsquo;re looking to keep directories and files in-sync across multiple devices it fits the bill quite well.</p>

    <id>http://njbiddle.com/blog/2014/02/10/unraid-nas</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I run an <a href="http://lime-technology.com/">unRAID</a> server at home for serving media, TimeMachine backups, managing libraries, and pretty much anything else I can throw at it. For being a small (under 500MB) slackware distro, it has huge potential.</p>

<br>


<p><img src="/images/unraid/unraid.png" alt="Unraid" /></p>

<br>


<!--more-->


<p>One of the main reasons I chose unRAID over alternatives, was being able to run a JBOD array. If I have a spare disk laying around, whether it&rsquo;s 500GB or 2TB, I can throw it in the unRAID box. I can lose one disk in my array, and still recover data via the parity disk, so it provides the redundancy I need for non-essential data (movies, music, etc).</p>

<br>


<p><img src="/images/unraid/unraid4.png" alt="Unraid Array" /></p>

<br>


<p>unRAID also runs off a USB key, which saves me a SATA port on my motherboard. I&rsquo;m running unRAID on an old Dell P4 machine I had laying around, and I&rsquo;ve never felt like I&rsquo;m running out of resources. unRAID is running a handful of media applications, and also acts as a <a href="http://plex.tv/">Plex</a> server. Highly recommended if you&rsquo;re into tinkering.</p>

    <link href="http://njbiddle.com/blog/2014/02/10/windows-8-dot-1-on-virtualbox/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-10T14:11:32-06:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Running multiple environments is critical for me both in IT and web development. I&rsquo;m currently using <a href="http://virtualbox.org">virtualbox</a> on my Mac to virtualize a windows 8.1 environment (I know, I know&hellip;). Click through for a quick walkthrough.</p>

<br>


<p><img src="/images/win8vm/win8vm4.png" alt="Win 8.1 VM" /></p>

<br>


<!--more-->


<p>I&rsquo;m using virtualbox over more popular alternatives such as VMWare Fusion and Parallels because of it&rsquo;s opensource nature and more technical community background. Windows 8.1 takes a little bit more time to configure, but it installs the same as any other VM.</p>

<br>


<p><img src="/images/win8vm/win8vm.png" alt="win 8.1 vm settings" /></p>

<br>


<ol>
<li>Create a new VM shell, be sure to select your correct distro and x86 vs x64</li>
<li>Boot to your ISO, PXE, disk, etc</li>
<li>Install like normal</li>
<li>Attempt to boot</li>
</ol>


<p>If you&rsquo;re having difficulties booting, check your storage controller and chipset config. I had trouble creating a SATA controller and booting to network (PXE boot), so I had to use an IDE virtual disk.</p>

<br>


<p><img src="/images/win8vm/win8vm2.png" alt="controller settings" /></p>

<br>


<p>Assign RAM and cpu appropriately, and select ICH9 chipset if you have issues.</p>
