After going through a number of media center front ends ([Boxee][boxeeurl], [Plex][plexurl], etc), I've stuck with [XBMC][xbmcurl]. It gives me the ability to customize the interface to my liking, run on older hardware, and play nearly anything I can throw at it.

I'm running XBMC on top of a [Ubuntu 13][ubuntuurl] install on an older corei3 machine I had laying around. It can output full 1080 resolution without skipping a beat over HDMI.

XBMC comes packed with features out of the box, but once you start customizing it's interface you really see where XBMC pulls ahead of other media center solutions.

You can even run third party plugins and applications inside of XBMC. For instance, I'm running apps to stream [Railscasts][railscastsurl] videos, Hulu, Soundcloud, etc.

Although buggy on Ubuntu, you can also run console ROMS out of XBMC's [ROM Collection Browser][romurl].

Finding an interface that works for you is important as well. I'm running the [nbox theme][nboxurl] by [Niamu][niamuurl], slightly customized to show me just what I need on screen, without added bloat or information.
