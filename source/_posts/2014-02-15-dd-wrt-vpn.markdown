If you're not already using a VPN, you need to start. Securing your traffic while on public networks and creating a simple point of access to your home network can be accomplished quickly if you're already using [DD-WRT][ddwrturl].

First, start running [DD-WRT][ddwrturl] or [Tomato][tomatourl] on your router at home. After you're up and running, configuring the VPN is easy. Head over to Services > VPN, and enter your config options as seen below:

NOTE: Be sure to use correct formatting in the username/password field

<code> username * password * </code>

Don't forget to enable PPTP VPN in Security > VPN Passthrough

Configure the VPN client-side, and you'll be good to go. If you need help, drop a line below.
