I run an [unRAID][unraidlink] server at home for serving media, TimeMachine backups, managing libraries, and pretty much anything else I can throw at it. For being a small (under 500MB) slackware distro, it has huge potential.

One of the main reasons I chose unRAID over alternatives, was being able to run a JBOD array. If I have a spare disk laying around, whether it's 500GB or 2TB, I can throw it in the unRAID box. I can lose one disk in my array, and still recover data via the parity disk, so it provides the redundancy I need for non-essential data (movies, music, etc).

unRAID also runs off a USB key, which saves me a SATA port on my motherboard. I'm running unRAID off an old Dell Pentium 4 machine I had laying around, and I've never felt like I'm running out of resources. unRAID is running a handful of media applications, and also acts as a [Plex][plexlink] server.
