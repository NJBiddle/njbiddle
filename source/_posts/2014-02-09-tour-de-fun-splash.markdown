[Tour De Fun][tdf] 2014 is quickly approaching, and so is a site redesign. Web/real-life wizard [Nic Aitch][nicaitch] is helping me build a ruby on rails info app and so far, it's been great.

We're using Active Admin and a gem by Nic called [Petrie][petrie] for content management. This lets other users on the Tour De Fun team edit content, bands, venues, and set times.
